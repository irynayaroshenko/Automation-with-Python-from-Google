"""
Smoke test sometimes called build verification test, get their name from a concept that comes from testing hardware equipment.
Plug in the given piece of hardware and see if smoke starts coming out of it. When writing software smoke test serve as
a kind of sanity check to find major bugs in a program. Smoke test answer basic questions like, does the program run?
These tests are usually run before more refined testing takes place. Since if the software fails the smoke test you can be pretty
sure none of the other tests will pass either.

Load tests.
These tests verify that the system behaves well when it's under significant load.
To actually perform these tests will need to generate traffic to our application simulating typical usage of the service.
These tests can be super-helpful when deploying new versions of our applications to verify that performance does not degrade.
