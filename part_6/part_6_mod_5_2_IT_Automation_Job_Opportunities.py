# Online job board
#
# 1. Jobs on Google Search https://www.google.com/search?q=IT+automation+jobs
#
# Searching for a job on Google Search is easy — just type your job search terms into the search bar at Google.com. Google Search will automatically search for jobs near you with the terms you choose (for example, IT Automation Engineer), using your current location.
#
# Not interested in staying in your current area or willing to relocate for the right position? You can filter your search. From the Google Search results page, find the jobs search box, headed in blue, and click on the “more jobs” link under the first few results. You’ll go to a search page with more options for filtering and sorting. From there, change the location, job type, employer, or any of the other filters. Click on the button and you’ll see your options, like full-time, contractor, part-time, and internship. Or, click the filter to look for jobs labeled as “work from home.” These are becoming much more common for all types of jobs!
#
# Google for Jobs is an aggregator, meaning it pulls job postings from all over the internet, including other job search boards, company websites, and government job portals. In other words, it’s extensive!
#
# 2. Indeed https://www.indeed.com/
#
# Indeed is another large job aggregator. Anyone can search on the website for free. It has similar filters as Jobs on Google Search. Each job posting includes a brief description of the job and a link to another website to apply. If you register with Indeed, you can create a profile and upload your resume so your searches are more targeted. You can also apply to some jobs directly through Indeed if you have an account.
#
# 3. Glassdoor https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm
#
# Glassdoor has a lot of similar features to Indeed and Jobs on Google Search. To search on Glassdoor, you need to create an account and provide some identifying information, like your job and education background. What sets Glassdoor apart from some of the other sites is the information about the companies posting jobs, including typical salaries for various positions within the company and example questions from interviews. Salaries and reviews are self-reported by Glassdoor’s users who are former and current employees of each company listed, so these reviews can be a useful tool for filling out your application or preparing for an interview.
#
# 4. ZipRecruiter https://www.ziprecruiter.com/
#
# Like Glassdoor, you need to register to use ZipRecruiter. Employers post their jobs directly to the site, and then ZipRecruiter matches interested applicants, based on their resumes, with the job postings. You can declare your interest in a particular job too, but you often don’t need to do so formally; the employer sees your interest and your resume and decides whether to contact you based on your perceived match for the job. You’ll get a notification if an employer reviews your information. Like most of the major job sites, you can also opt in to receive emails from the website with potential job matches
#
# 5. Job boards for IT professionals (Dice.com https://dice.com/jobs
# TechCareers.com https://www.techcareers.com/jobs/search
# Upwork.com https://www.upwork.com/cat/dev-it
#
# Creating a profile and posting your resume to Job boards that are specifically tailored to technical professions may boost your visibility to hiring managers in IT. You will usually find full-time job leads on job boards like Dice.com and TechCareers.com. On job boards like Upwork.com, you advertise yourself and state your hourly rate. Employers search these boards to find contractors for short-term project work. Contractor work is a good option for building work experience through a variety of different types of projects. You can also build a diverse professional network through short assignments. If you make a great impression as a contractor, you may receive offers for more contract work, or you could receive an offer for full-time employment.
#
# 6. Linkedin
#
# You’re likely already very familiar with LinkedIn. If you have already created an account on the professional networking site and filled in your professional background and resume, you’re already halfway to applying for jobs here! You don’t have to register with LinkedIn to look for jobs, but there are a lot of benefits to doing so. Many recruiters and hiring managers use LinkedIn to find potential employees or freelancers; if you’re actively looking for a job, it’s often as simple as signaling that you’re open to opportunities, a setting within your LinkedIn profile page. You can also search for and apply to jobs directly from LinkedIn. Sometimes you’ll be taken to a company website to formally apply; other times, you might just share your profile and interest in the job with the hiring manager and wait for someone to contact you.
#
# Either way, the most important things to do for LinkedIn is keep your profile up to date and link to your professional portfolio. One other option: You can ask your connections, either former employers or classmates, to recommend you and write testimonials to be posted on your profile. This reinforces your work ethic as an employee and talents as an IT Automation Engineer.
#
# This list is just a selection of the job-search sites available to you as an IT Automation Engineer. As you click or scroll through each site, you might find benefits or drawbacks to a specific job board that makes it more or less suitable to your needs. If you live in a major city, you’ll probably have plenty of opportunities available to you. If you live in a smaller town, or you want to work remotely, you may have to look a little harder to figure out your options. (There’s always your local newspaper and small businesses near you!) But with any luck, you’ll have a variety of positions to choose from when you’re ready to start your new career.

# Networking opportunities
#
# Of course, online job boards aren’t the only option for your job search. Networking, whether it’s in person or online, is a hugely important method for finding jobs in any field, IT automation included.
#
# Linkedin
#
# Okay, so you already learned about LinkedIn in this reading. But it’s not just a place to apply for jobs. Recruiters actively seek out potential employees on the site, but you don’t have to wait until they come to you! Connecting with recruiters on LinkedIn is perfectly acceptable. You might look for a recruiter from a local agency you’ve heard good things about; or, if you’re interested in working at a specific company, you can seek out recruiters who work for that organization already. Politely express interest in any open jobs, and see what happens! LinkedIn is also the place to connect with former colleagues, managers, or teachers. Let your network know you’re starting a new career in IT automation. Most people love to help others!
#
# Conferences. Whether they’re online or in person, industry conferences are useful in many ways. You learn more about your field during presentations and panels; you meet other people who are working in the industry; and you connect with hiring managers who are looking to expand their teams. Not everyone goes to a conference looking for a new hire. However, they’re a great opportunity to meet new people, and new connections mean new opportunities for jobs in the future. Search online for IT professional conferences near you or in an area you would be willing to travel to.
#
# Job fairs. Job fairs are often hosted by a group of employers that are interested in hiring new talent or advertising their company as a great place to work. Although a job fair isn’t as likely to be focused solely on IT automation, it is likely that companies who attend will need to hire IT Automation Engineers. You might be surprised by who you meet and what roles you can find. To find a job fair near you, check with local high schools, community colleges, universities, and workforce development programs.
#
# It might seem overwhelming when you begin your job search. There are so many places to look at so many job openings to sort through. But the more you research, the easier it’ll be to pinpoint the exact type of job you’d like to apply for. And you’ll be on your way to snagging that first interview. Get ready, because that day is coming up soon!
