"""Qwiklabs Assessment: Pushing Local Commits to GitHub"""
# Introduction
# For this project, you'll need to fork an existing repository, fix a bug in a script, push your commit to GitHub,
# and create a pull request with your commit.

# - Fork another repository
# - Commit changes to your own fork and create pull requests to the upstream repository
# - Gain familiarity with code reviews, ensure that your fix runs fine on your system before creating the pull request
# - Describe your pull request

"""Forking and detect function behavior (All commands' outputs see in the end of file)"""
# For this exercise, you need to fork an existing repository: google/it-cert-automation-practice.

#     Open GitHub. If you don't already have a GitHub account, create one by entering a username, email, and password.
#     If you already have a GitHub account proceed to the next step.
#     Log in to your account from the GitHub login page.

# A fork is a copy of a repository.
# Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

# Forking a repository is a simple two-step process. We've created a repository for you to practice with!
# - On GitHub, navigate to the google/it-cert-automation-practice repository.
# - In the top-right corner of the page, click 'Fork'.
# That's it! Now, you have a fork of the original google/it-cert-automation-practice repository.

# First, clone the repository using the following command:

# git clone https://github.com/[git-username]/it-cert-automation-practice.git

# Note: If you enabled two-factor authentication in your Github account you won't be able to push via HTTPS using your
# accountâ€™s password. Instead you need to generate a personal access token. This can be done in the application settings
# of your Github account. Using this token as your password should allow you to push to your remote repository via HTTPS
# Use your username as usual. Note down this personal access token as we would need it further in the lab. For more help
# to generate a personal access token, click here.

# Go to the it-cert-automation-practice directory using the following command:

# cd ~/it-cert-automation-practice

# First, verify that you have already setup a remote for the upstream repository, and an origin.Type the following
# command and press Enter. You'll see the current configured remote repository for your fork.

# git remote -v

# In terms of source control, you're "downstream" when you copy (clone, checkout, etc) from a repository. Information is
# flowed "downstream" to you.
#
# When you make changes, you usually want to send them back "upstream" so they make it into that repository so that
# everyone pulling from the same source is working with all the same changes. This is mostly a social issue of how
# everyone can coordinate their work rather than a technical requirement of source control. You want to get your changes
# into the main project so you're not tracking divergent lines of development.
#
# Setting the upstream for a fork you have created using the following command:

# git remote add upstream https://github.com/irynayaroshenko/it-cert-automation-practice.git

# To verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork, type git remote -v again. You should see the
# URL for your fork as origin, and the URL for the original repository as upstream.

# git remote -v


"""Configure Git"""

# Git uses a username to associate commits with an identity. It does this by using the git config command. Set the Git
# username with the following command:

# git config --global user.name "Name"

# Replace Name with your name. Any future commits you push to GitHub from the command line will now be represented by
# this name. You can even use git config to change the name associated with your Git commits. This will only affect
# future commits and won't change the name used for past commits.
#
# Let's set your email address to associate them with your Git commits.

# git config --global user.email "user@example.com"

# Replace user@example.com with your email-id. Any future commits you now push to GitHub will be associated with this
# email address. You can also use git config to change the user email associated with your Git commits.

"""Fix the script"""
# In this section we are going to fix an issue that has been filed. Navigate to the issue, and have a look at it.
#
# Branches allow you to add new features or test out ideas without putting your main project at risk. In order to add
# new changes into the repo directory it-cert-automation-practice/Course3/Lab4/, create a new branch named
# improve-username-behavior in your forked repository using the following command:

# git checkout -b improve-username-behavior

# Now, navigate to the working directory Lab4/ and list the files in directory Lab4.

# cd ~/it-cert-automation-practice/Course3/Lab4

# ls -l

# Now, open the validations.py script.

# cat validations.py

# This script should validate usernames if they start with a letter only.
# Here, you can check the validate_user function's behavior by calling the function. To edit the validations.py
# Python script, open it in a nano editor using the following command:

# nano validations.py

# Now, add the following lines of code at the end of the script:

# print(validate_user("blue.kale", 3)) # True
# print(validate_user(".blue.kale", 3)) # Currently True, should be False
# print(validate_user("red_quinoa", 4)) # True
# print(validate_user("_red_quinoa", 4)) # Currently True, should be False

# Once you've finished writing this script, save the file by pressing Ctrl-o, the Enter key, and Ctrl-x.
#
# Now, run the validations.py on the python3 interpreter.

# python3 validations.py

# Output: all checks return True which is incorrect.

# Here, as we see the output, it function returns true even if the username doesnot start with an letter. Here we need
# to change the check of the first character as only letters are allowed in the first character of the username.
#
# Continue by opening validations.py in the nano editor using the following command:

# nano validations.py

# There are lots of ways to fix the code; ultimately, you'll want to add additional conditional checks to validate the
# first character doesn't start with either of the forbidden characters. You can choose whichever way you'd like to
# implement this.
# Once you've finished writing this script, save the file by pressing Ctrl-o, the Enter key, and Ctrl-x.
#
# Now, run the validations.py.

# python3 validations.py

# Output:
# True
# False
# True
# False

# Fixed script:

import re


def validate_user(username, minlen):
    """Checks if the received username matches the required conditions."""
    if type(username) != str:
        raise TypeError("username must be a string")
    if minlen < 1:
        raise ValueError("minlen must be at least 1")

    # Usernames can't be shorter than minlen
    if len(username) < minlen:
        return False
    # Usernames can only use letters, numbers, dots and underscores
    if not re.match('^[a-z0-9._]*$', username):
        return False
    # Usernames can't begin with a number
    if username[0].isnumeric():
        return False
    if not username[0].isalpha():
        return False
    return True

print(validate_user("blue.kale", 3)) # True
print(validate_user(".blue.kale", 3)) # Currently True, should be False
print(validate_user("red_quinoa", 4)) # True
print(validate_user("_red_quinoa", 4)) # Currently True, should be False


"""Commit the changes"""

# Once the issue is fixed and verified, create a new commit by adding the file to the staging area. You can check the
# status using the following command:

# git status

# The git status command shows the different states of the files in your working directory and staging area, like files
# that are modified but unstaged and files that are staged but not yet committed.
#
# You can now see that the validations.py has been modified.

# Now, let's add the file to the staging area using the following command:

# git add validations.py

# Use the git add command to add content from the working directory into the staging area for the next commit.

# git status

# Let's now commit the changes. A git commit is like saving your work.
#
# Commit the changes using the following command:

# git commit

# This now opens up an editor that asks you to type a commit message. Every commit has an associated commit message,
# which is a log message from the user describing the changes.
#
# Enter a commit message of your choice and append a line: "Closes: #1" at the beginning to indicate that you're closing
# the issue. Adding this keyword has an additional effect when using Github to manage your repos, which will
# automatically close the issue for you (for more information, please see the documentation
# https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords#closing-an-issue-in-the-same-repository).

# Closes: #1
# Updated validations.py python script.
# Fixed the behavior of validate_user function in validations.py.

# Once you've entered the commit message, save it by pressing Ctrl-o and the Enter key. To exit, click Ctrl-x.

"""Push changes"""

# You forked a repository and made changes to the fork. Now you can ask that the upstream repository accept your
# changes by creating a pull request. Now, let's push the changes.

# git push origin improve-username-behavior

# Note: If you have enabled two-factor authentication in your Github account, use the personal access token generated
# earlier during the lab as the password. If you have not noted down the personal access token earlier, go to your
# Github homepage > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens. Now click on the token you generated earlier
# and click 'Regenerate token'. Use your username as usual.

# Then, from GitHub, create a pull request from your forked repository [git-username]/it-cert-automation-practice that
# includes a description of your change. Your branch improve-username-behavior is now able to merge into the master
# branch. It should look like the image below:

# After initializing a pull request, you'll see a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes between
# your branch (the compare branch) and the repository's base branch. You can add a summary of the proposed changes,
# review the changes made by commits, add labels, milestones, and assignees, and @mention individual contributors or
# teams.
#
# Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your topic branch to add them to your existing pull
# request. These commits will appear in chronological order within your pull request and the changes will be visible in
# the "Files changed" tab.
#
# Other contributors can review your proposed changes, add review comments, contribute to the pull request discussion,
# and even add commits to the pull request.
#
# You can see information about the branch's current deployment status and past deployment activity on the
# "Conversation" tab.

# Note: PR won't be merged on the master branch so that other users can also make a similar change to fix the issue.
